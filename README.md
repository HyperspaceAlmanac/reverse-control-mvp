# reverse-control-mvp
Experimenting with making an action game control scheme that uses mouse to move and keys for actions.

This will be a minimal viable product and a proof of concept that such controls can work.

Not sure if this has been done before. Putting this out there now to have establish a history.

# Goals:

1. Tracks mouse movement in a buffer before pressing LMB for basic movement, and RMB for more advanced movement (roll, teleport, etc.)

2. Check if default hand position feels good to use.

ASDF + G for main actions, thumb on spacebar.

Access to QWER + T and ZXCV + B for quick tap action, and then go back to ASDF.

# Going to make my own basic model added to .gitignore.

# If all goes well, I might make full tech demo.
